# Suspend-Klipper-Until-Endstop-Triggers
Klipper module that adds a G-code command so Klipper will pause until specified endstop is triggered.

This is migrated from Klipper Toolchanger code.
It can for example be used by a Jubilee style toolchanger to check if tool is locked.
If it is not locked in place it will pause until it is.
